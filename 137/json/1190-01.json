        "text": "Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\nIn the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8901 et seq., Congress authorized the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to contract with private carriers for federal employees' health insurance. \u00a7 8902(a), (d). FEHBA contains a provision expressly preempting state law. \u00a7 8902(m)(1). That provision reads:\n\"The terms of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans.\"\nContracts OPM negotiates with private carriers provide for reimbursement and subrogation. Reimbursement requires an insured employee who receives payment from another source (e.g., the proceeds yielded by a tort claim) to return healthcare costs earlier paid out by the carrier. Subrogation involves transfer of the right to a third-party payment from the insured employee to the carrier, who can then pursue the claim against the third party. Several States, however, Missouri among them, bar enforcement of contractual subrogation and reimbursement provisions.\nThe questions here presented: Does FEHBA's express-preemption prescription, \u00a7 8902(m)(1), override state law prohibiting subrogation and reimbursement; and if \u00a7 8902(m)(1) has that effect, is the statutory prescription consistent with the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2 ? We hold, contrary to the decision of the Missouri Supreme Court, that contractual subrogation and reimbursement prescriptions plainly \"relate to ... payments with respect to benefits,\" \u00a7 8902(m)(1) ; therefore, by statutory instruction, they override state law barring subrogation and reimbursement. We further hold, again contrary to the Missouri Supreme Court, that the regime Congress enacted is compatible with the Supremacy Clause. Section 8902(m)(1) itself, not the contracts OPM negotiates, triggers the federal preemption. As Congress directed, where FEHBA contract terms \"relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits),\" \u00a7 8902(m)(1) ensures that those terms will be uniformly enforceable nationwide, free from state interference.\nI\nA\nFEHBA \"establishes a comprehensive program of health insurance for federal employees.\" Empire Healthchoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 547 U.S. 677, 682, 126 S.Ct. 2121, 165 L.Ed.2d 131 (2006). As just noted, supra, at 1194, FEHBA\ncontains an express-preemption provision, \u00a7 8902(m)(1). FEHBA assigns to OPM broad administrative and rulemaking authority over the program. See \u00a7\u00a7 8901 - 8913. OPM contracts with private insurance carriers to offer a range of healthcare plans. \u00a7\u00a7 8902, 8903.\nOPM's contracts with private carriers have long included provisions requiring those carriers to seek subrogation and reimbursement. Accordingly, OPM has issued detailed regulations governing subrogation and reimbursement clauses in FEHBA contracts. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 890.106 (2016). Under those regulations, a carrier's \"right to pursue and receive subrogation and reimbursement recoveries constitutes a condition of and a limitation on the nature of benefits or benefit payments and on the provision of benefits under the plan's coverage.\" \u00a7 890.106(b)(1).\nIn 2015, after notice and comment, OPM published a rule confirming that \"[a] carrier's rights and responsibilities pertaining to subrogation and reimbursement under any [FEHBA] contract relate to the nature, provision, and extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) within the meaning of\" \u00a7 8902(m)(1). \u00a7 890.106(h). Such \"rights and responsibilities,\" OPM's rule provides, \"are ... effective notwithstanding any state or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans.\" Ibid. Its rule, OPM explained, \"comports with longstanding Federal policy and furthers Congres[s'] goals of reducing health care costs and enabling uniform, nationwide application of [FEHBA] contracts.\" 80 Fed.Reg. 29203 (2015) (final rule).\nB\nRespondent Jodie Nevils is a former federal employee who enrolled in and was insured under a FEHBA plan offered by petitioner Coventry Health Care of Missouri. Nevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 418 S.W.3d 451, 453 (Mo.2014) (Nevils I ). When Nevils was injured in an automobile accident, Coventry paid his medical expenses. Ibid. Nevils sued the driver who caused his injuries and recovered a settlement award. Ibid. Based on its contract with OPM, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a-130a, Coventry asserted a lien for $6,592.24 against part of the settlement proceeds to cover medical bills it had paid. Nevils I, 418 S.W.3d, at 453. Nevils repaid that amount, thereby satisfying the lien. Ibid.\nNevils then filed this class action against Coventry in Missouri state court, alleging that Coventry had unlawfully obtained reimbursement. Ibid. Nevils premised his claim on Missouri law, which does not permit subrogation or reimbursement in this context, see, e.g., Benton House, LLC v. Cook & Younts Ins., Inc., 249 S.W.3d 878, 881-882 (Mo.App.2008). Coventry countered that \u00a7 8902(m)(1) makes subrogation and reimbursement clauses in FEHBA contracts enforceable notwithstanding state law. The trial court granted summary judgment in Coventry's favor, Nevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., No. 11SL-CC00535 (Cir. Ct., St. Louis Cty., Mo., May 21, 2012), App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a, 32a, and the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, Nevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 2012 WL 6689542, *5 (Dec. 26, 2012).\nThe Missouri Supreme Court reversed. Nevils I, 418 S.W.3d, at 457. That court began with \"the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by ... Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\" Id., at 454 (quoting Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) ) (alterations in original). Finding \u00a7 8902(m)(1) susceptible to diverse \"plausible readings,\" the court invoked a \"presumption against preemption\" to conclude that the federal statute's preemptive scope excluded subrogation and reimbursement. 418 S.W.3d, at 455.\nJudge Wilson, joined by Judge Breckenridge, concurred in the judgment. Id., at 457. Observing that \"it defies logic to insist that benefit repayment terms do not relate to the nature or extent of Nevils' benefits,\" id., at 460 (emphasis deleted), Judge Wilson concluded that \"Congress plainly intended for \u00a7 8902(m)(1) to apply to the benefit repayment terms in [Coventry's] contract,\" id., at 462. He nevertheless concurred, reasoning that the Supremacy Clause did not authorize preemption based on the terms of FEHBA contracts. Id., at 462-465.\nCoventry sought our review, and we invited the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the United States. Coventry Health Care of Mo., Inc. v. Nevils, 574 U.S. ----, 135 S.Ct. 323, 190 L.Ed.2d 19 (2014). While Coventry's petition was pending, OPM finalized its rule governing subrogation and reimbursement. See supra, at 1195. This Court granted certiorari, vacated the Missouri Supreme Court's judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of OPM's recently adopted rule. Coventry Health Care of Mo., Inc. v. Nevils, 576 U.S. ----, 135 S.Ct. 2886, 192 L.Ed.2d 918 (2015).\nOn remand, the Missouri Supreme Court adhered to its earlier decision. Nevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 492 S.W.3d 918, 920, 925 (2016). OPM's rule, the court maintained, \"does not overcome the presumption against preemption and demonstrate Congress' clear and manifest intent to preempt state law.\" Id., at 920.\nJudge Wilson again concurred, this time joined by a majority of the judges of the Missouri Supreme Court. Id., at 925. In their view, Congress' \"attempt to give preemptive effect to the provisions of a contract between the federal government and a private party is not a valid application of the Supremacy Clause\" and, \"therefore, does not displace Missouri law here.\" Ibid.\nWe granted certiorari to resolve conflicting interpretations of \u00a7 8902(m)(1). 580 U.S. ----, 137 S.Ct. 446, 196 L.Ed.2d 326 (2016). Compare 492 S.W.2d, at 925 (majority opinion), with Bell v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Okla., 823 F.3d 1198, 1199 (C.A.8 2016) ( \u00a7 8902(m)(1) preempts state antisubrogation law); Helfrich v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield Assn., 804 F.3d 1090, 1092 (C.A.10 2015) (same).\nII\nSection 8902(m)(1) places two preconditions on federal preemption. See supra, at 1194. The parties agree that Missouri's law prohibiting subrogation and reimbursement meets one of the two limitations, i.e., the State's law \"relates to health insurance or plans.\" \u00a7 8902(m)(1). They dispute only whether the subrogation and reimbursement requirements in OPM's contract with Coventry \"relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits,\" \"including payments with respect to benefits.\" Ibid.\nCoventry contends that \u00a7 8902(m)(1) unambiguously covers the contractual terms at issue here. In any event, Coventry, joined by the United States as amicus curiae, urges that the rule published by OPM in 2015 leaves no room for doubt that insurance-contract terms providing for subrogation and reimbursement fall within \u00a7 8902(m)(1)'s preemptive scope. See supra, at 1195. Deference is due to OPM's reading, Coventry and the United States assert, under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). In Nevils' view, by contrast, \u00a7 8902(m)(1) does not preempt state antisubrogation and antireimbursement laws in light of the presumption against preemption. Given that presumption, Nevils maintains, OPM's rule is not entitled to deference. Though we have called Nevils' construction \"plausible,\" McVeigh, 547 U.S., at 698, 126 S.Ct. 2121 the reading advanced by Coventry and the United States best comports with \u00a7 8902(m)(1)'s text, context, and purpose.\nA\nContractual provisions for subrogation and reimbursement \"relate to ... payments with respect to benefits\" because subrogation and reimbursement rights yield just such payments. When a carrier exercises its right to either reimbursement or subrogation, it receives from either the beneficiary or a third party \"payment\" respecting the benefits the carrier had previously paid. The carrier's very provision of benefits triggers the right to payment. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31; Helfrich, 804 F.3d, at 1106 ; Bell, 823 F.3d, at 1204.\nCongress' use of the expansive phrase \"relate to\" shores up that understanding. We have \"repeatedly recognized\" that the phrase \"relate to\" in a preemption clause \"express[es] a broad pre-emptive purpose.\" Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992) ; accord Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg, 572 U.S. ----, ----, ----, 134 S.Ct. 1422, 1428, 1430, 188 L.Ed.2d 538 (2014). Congress characteristically employs the phrase to reach any subject that has \"a connection with, or reference to,\" the topics the statute enumerates. Morales, 504 U.S., at 384, 112 S.Ct. 2031. The phrase therefore weighs against Nevils' effort to narrow the term \"payments\" to exclude payments that occur \"long after\" a carrier's provision of benefits (Brief for Respondent 27 (quoting McVeigh, 547 U.S., at 697, 126 S.Ct. 2121 )). See Nevils I, 418 S.W.3d, at 460 (Wilson, J., concurring); cf. Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U.S. ----, ----, 133 S.Ct. 1943, 1952, 186 L.Ed.2d 43 (2013) (in the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Act context, it \"makes no difference\" whether state law withholds benefits in the first instance or instead takes them away after they have been paid). Given language notably \"expansive [in] sweep,\" Morales, 504 U.S., at 384, 112 S.Ct. 2031 (internal quotation marks omitted), Nevils' argument that Congress intended to preempt only state coverage requirements (e.g., for acupuncture and chiropractic services, see Brief for Respondent 36) also miscarries.\nThe statutory context and purpose reinforce our conclusion. FEHBA concerns \"benefits from a federal health insurance plan for federal employees that arise from a federal law\" in an area with a \"long history of federal involvement.\" Bell, 823 F.3d, at 1202. Strong and \"distinctly federal interests are involved,\" McVeigh, 547 U.S., at 696, 126 S.Ct. 2121 in uniform administration of the program, free from state interference, particularly in regard to coverage, benefits, and payments. The Federal Government, moreover, has a significant financial stake. OPM estimates that, in 2014 alone, FEHBA \"carriers were reimbursed by approximately $126 million in subrogation recoveries.\" 80 Fed.Reg. 29203. Such \"recoveries translate to premium cost savings for the federal government and [FEHBA] enrollees.\" Ibid.\nB\nInvoking our suggestion in McVeigh that \u00a7 8902(m)(1) has two \"plausible\" interpretations, 547 U.S., at 698, 126 S.Ct. 2121 Nevils nonetheless urges us to apply a presumption against preemption because \u00a7 8902(m)(1) does not clearly cover contractual terms pertaining to subrogation and reimbursement. This argument is blind to McVeigh 's context.\nIn McVeigh, we considered the discrete question whether 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 gives federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over FEHBA reimbursement actions. See 547 U.S., at 683, 126 S.Ct. 2121. Our principal holding was that \u00a7 1331 did not confer federal jurisdiction. Ibid. ; see Bell, 823 F.3d, at 1205.\nThe carrier in McVeigh, as part of its argument in favor of federal jurisdiction, asserted that \u00a7 8902(m)(1) itself conferred federal jurisdiction. See 547 U.S., at 697, 126 S.Ct. 2121. In responding to that assertion, we summarized competing interpretations of \u00a7 8902(m)(1) advanced in briefing, readings that map closely onto the parties' positions here. See ibid. (carrier and United States as amicus curiae urged interpretation similar to Coventry's; an amicus brief in support of beneficiary offered interpretation similar to Nevils').\nWe made no choice between the two interpretations set out in McVeigh, however, because the answer made no difference to the question there presented. Id., at 698, 126 S.Ct. 2121. \"[E]ven if FEHBA's preemption provision reaches contract-based reimbursement claims,\" we explained, \"that provision is not sufficiently broad to confer federal jurisdiction.\" Ibid. Because \u00a7 8902(m)(1) is a \"choice-of-law prescription,\" not a \"jurisdiction-conferring provision,\" id., at 697, 126 S.Ct. 2121 we had no cause to consider \u00a7 8902(m)(1)'s text, context, and purpose, as we do today, see supra, at 1196 - 1198.\nIII\nNevils further contends that, if \u00a7 8902(m)(1) covers subrogation and reimbursement clauses in OPM contracts, then the statute itself would violate the Supremacy Clause by assigning preemptive effect to the terms of a contract, not to the laws of the United States. We conclude, however, that the statute, not a contract, strips state law of its force.\nWithout \u00a7 8902(m)(1), there would be no preemption of state insurance law. FEHBA contract terms have preemptive force only as they \"relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits),\" \u00a7 8902(m)(1) -i.e., when the contract terms fall within the statute's preemptive scope. It is therefore the statute that \"ensures that [FEHBA contract] terms will be uniformly enforceable nationwide, notwithstanding any state law relating to health insurance or plans.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nMany other federal statutes preempt state law in this way, leaving the context-specific scope of preemption to contractual terms. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq., for example, preempts \"any and all State laws insofar as they ... relate to any employee benefit plan.\" \u00a7 1144(a). And the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq., limits the grounds for denying enforcement of \"written provision[s] in ... contract[s]\" providing for arbitration, thereby preempting state laws that would otherwise interfere with such contracts. \u00a7 2. This Court has several times held that those statutes preempt state law, see, e.g., Gobeille v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 577 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 136 S.Ct. 936, 942-947, 194 L.Ed.2d 20 (2016) (ERISA); Marmet Health Care Center, Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.S. 530, 532-534, 132 S.Ct. 1201, 182 L.Ed.2d 42 (2012) (per curiam ) (FAA), and Nevils does not contend that those measures violate the Supremacy Clause, see Brief for Respondent 22.\nNevils instead attempts to distinguish those other statutes by highlighting a particular textual feature of \u00a7 8902(m)(1) : Section 8902(m)(1) states that the \"terms of any contract \" between OPM and a carrier \"shall supersede and preempt\" certain state or local laws. (Emphasis added.) That formulation, Nevils asserts, violates the Supremacy Clause's mandate that only the \"Laws of the United States\" may reign supreme over state law. U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2 (emphasis added). Nevils' argument elevates semantics over substance. While Congress' formulation might differ from the phrasing of other statutes, \u00a7 8902(m)(1) manifests the same intent to preempt state law. Because we do not require Congress to employ a particular linguistic formulation when preempting state law, Nevils' Supremacy Clause challenge fails.\nFor the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nJustice GORSUCH took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nCoventry was formerly known as Group Health Plan, Inc. Pet. for Cert. ii. We refer to both the current and former entities as \"Coventry.\"\nUnder Missouri law, a \"concurring opinion\" in which \"a majority of the court concur[s]\" is binding precedent. Mueller v. Burchfield, 359 Mo. 876, 880, 224 S.W.2d 87, 89 (1949).\nBecause the statute alone resolves this dispute, we need not consider whether Chevron deference attaches to OPM's 2015 rule.\nCongress' choice of language is not unique to \u00a7 8902(m)(1). Several related statutes governing federal-employee and military-member benefits employ similar formulations. See \u00a7 8959 (\"The terms of any contract that relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to dental benefits, insurance, plans, or contracts.\"); \u00a7 8989 (same for vision); \u00a7 9005(a) (same for long-term care); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a) (certain state laws \"shall not apply to any contract entered into pursuant to this chapter\").\nNevils' speculation about the Government's outsourcing preemption to private entities, see Brief for Respondent 24, is far afield from the matter before us. This case involves only Congress' preemption of state insurance laws to ensure that the terms in contracts negotiated by OPM, a federal agency, operate free from state interference.\n* * *",

A statute that confers on an executive agency the power to enter into contracts that pre-empt state law-such as the Federal Employee Health Benefits Act of 1959, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8902 -might unlawfully delegate legislative power to the President insofar as the statute fails sufficiently to constrain the President's contracting discretion.
