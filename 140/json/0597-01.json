That decision is in conflict with the decisions of several other Circuits, which have indicated that district courts retain inherent authority to release grand jury material in other appropriate cases. See, e.g., Carlson v. United States , 837 F.3d 753, 766-767 (C.A.7 2016) ; In re Craig , 131 F.3d 99, 105 (C.A.2 1997) ; In re Hastings , 735 F.2d 1261, 1271-1272 (C.A.11 1984). It also appears to conflict with the considered views of the Rules Committee. See Advisory Committee Minutes on Crim. Rules 7 (Apr. 22-23 2012), https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/fr_import/criminal-min-04-2012.pdf.\nWhether district courts retain authority to release grand jury material outside those situations specifically enumerated in the Rules, or in situations like this, is an important question. It is one I think the Rules Committee both can and should revisit.",
