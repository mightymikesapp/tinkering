Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U.S. 127, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994), and Foster v. Chatman, 578 U.S. ----, 136 S.Ct. 1737, 195 L.Ed.2d 1 (2016). Although the unique context of Floyd's case counsels against review by this Court, I find the underlying facts sufficiently troubling to note that in the ordinary course, facts like these likely would warrant a court's intervention.\nDuring voir dire, the Houston County District Attorney's Office exercised peremptory challenges against 10 out of 11 qualified African-American venire members, and used 12 of its 18 strikes against women. The prosecutor also marked the letter \" 'B,' as in black,\" next to the name of each potential African-American juror. 2 Supp. Record, Reporter's Tr. 58 (Nov. 13, 2007).\nIf these facts sound familiar, it is because they are remarkably similar to those in Foster, where we concluded that peremptory strikes of jurors \"were 'motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.' \" 578 U.S., at ----, 136 S.Ct., at 1754 (quoting Snyder v.
