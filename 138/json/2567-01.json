Moreover, petitioner admits that he cited and advanced arguments based on Lee in both his petition for rehearing before the Indiana Court of Appeals and his petition for transfer to the Indiana Supreme Court. Reply Brief 3. I would accordingly deny the petition for the reasons stated in Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in Webster v. Cooper, 558 U.S. 1039, 1040, 130 S.Ct. 456, 175 L.Ed.2d 506 (2009).",
