McDonough, 547 U.S. 573, 584, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44 (2016). The All Writs Act does not excuse a court from making these findings. Because the District Court enjoined respondent's execution without finding that he has a significant possibility of success on the merits, it abused its discretion. We accordingly vacate the injunction.\nJustice BREYER and Justice SOTOMAYOR would deny the application to vacate the injunction."
