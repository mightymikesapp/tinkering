TRUMP, President of the United States, et al., applicants,\nv.\nHAWAII, et al.\nNo. 17A550.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nDec. 4, 2017.\nThe application for a stay presented to Justice KENNEDY and by him referred to the Court is granted, and the District Court's October 20, 2017 order granting a preliminary injunction is stayed pending disposition of the Government's appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and disposition of the Government's petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is sought. If a writ of certiorari is sought and the Court denies the petition, this order shall terminate automatically. If the Court grants the petition for a writ of certiorari, this order shall terminate when the Court enters its judgment.\nIn light of its decision to consider the case on an expedited basis, we expect that the Court of Appeals will render its decision with appropriate dispatch.\nJustice GINSBURG and Justice SOTOMAYOR would deny the application."
