    "head_matter": "Rebekah GEE, Secretary, Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals\nv.\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD OF GULF COAST, INC., et al.\nNo. 17-1492.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nDec. 10, 2018.\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\nJustice THOMAS, with whom Justice ALITO and Justice GORSUCH join, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\nOne of this Court's primary functions is to resolve \"important matter[s]\" on which the courts of appeals are \"in conflict.\" Sup. Ct. Rule 10(a); e.g., Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 106, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995). This case and Andersen v. Planned Parenthood of Kan. and Mid-Missouri, No. 17-1340, present a conflict on a federal question with significant implications: whether Medicaid recipients have a private right of action to challenge a State's determination of \"qualified\" Medicaid providers under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23) and Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Five Circuits have held that Medicaid recipients have such a right, and one Circuit has held that they do not. The last three Circuits to consider the question have themselves been divided.\nThis question is important and recurring. Around 70 million Americans are on Medicaid, and the question presented directly affects their rights. If the majority of the courts of appeals are correct, then Medicaid patients could sue when, for example, a State removes their doctor as a Medicaid provider or inadequately reimburses their provider.

Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 282-283, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002). We have \"[f]uel[ed] this uncertainty\" by equivocating on whether the standards for implying private rights of action have any \"bearing on the standards for discerning whether a statute creates rights enforceable by \u00a7 1983.\" Id., at 283, 122 S.Ct. 2268. Courts are not even able to identify which of our decisions are \"binding\"; in Planned Parenthood of Kan. v. Andersen, 882 F.3d 1205 (C.A.10 2018), the Court of Appeals applied a decision that this Court recently said had been \" 'plainly repudiate[d].' \" Id ., at 1229, and n. 16 (quoting Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc ., 575 U.S. ----, ----, n., 135 S.Ct. 1378, n., 1386 191 L.Ed.2d 471 (2015), in turn citing Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn ., 496 U.S. 498, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990) ). One can hardly blame the Tenth Circuit for misunderstanding. We created this confusion. We should clear it up.\nSo what explains the Court's refusal to do its job here? I suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named \"Planned Parenthood.\" That makes the Court's decision particularly troubling, as the question presented has nothing to do with abortion. It is true that these particular cases arose after several States alleged that Planned Parenthood affiliates had, among other things, engaged in \"the illegal sale of fetal organs\" and \"fraudulent billing practices,\" and thus removed Planned Parenthood as a state Medicaid provider. Andersen, 882 F.3d, at 1239, n. 2 (Bacharach, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). But these cases are not about abortion rights. They are about private rights of action under the Medicaid Act. Resolving the question presented here would not even affect Planned Parenthood's ability to challenge the States' decisions; it concerns only the rights of individual Medicaid patients to bring their own suits.\nSome tenuous connection to a politically fraught issue does not justify abdicating our judicial duty. If anything, neutrally applying the law is all the more important when political issues are in the background. The Framers gave us lifetime tenure to promote \"that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful performance\" of the courts' role as \"bulwarks of a limited Constitution,\" unaffected by fleeting \"mischiefs.\" The Federalist No. 78, pp. 469-470 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). We are not \"to consult popularity,\" but instead to rely on \"nothing ... but the Constitution and the laws.\" Id., at 471.\nWe are responsible for the confusion among the lower courts, and it is our job to fix it. I respectfully dissent from the Court's decision to deny certiorari.\nCompare Planned Parenthood of Kan. v. Andersen, 882 F.3d 1205, 1225-1229 (C.A.10 2018); 862 F.3d 445, 457-462 (C.A.5 2017) (case below); Planned Parenthood of Ariz., Inc. v.
