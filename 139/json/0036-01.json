Using the results of the test after her arrest and the rate at which alcohol is metabolized, this analyst sought to estimate for the jury Ms. Stuart's blood-alcohol level hours earlier when she was driving. Through these steps, the State effectively denied Ms. Stuart the chance to confront the witness who supplied a foundational piece of evidence in her conviction.

This is so, the State says, because it didn't offer the report for the truth of what it said about Ms. Stuart's blood-alcohol level at the time of the test, only to provide the State's testifying expert a basis for estimating Ms. Stuart's blood-alcohol level when she was driving.",

Meanwhile, four dissenting Justices took the broader view that even a report devised purely for investigatory purposes without a target in mind can qualify as testimonial when it is \"made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that [it] would be available for use at a later trial.\" Id., at 121, 132 S.Ct. 2221 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). But however you slice it, a routine postarrest forensic report like the one here must qualify as testimonial.

Amdt. 6.\nThat promise was broken here. To prove Vanessa Stuart was driving under the influence, the State of Alabama introduced in evidence the results of a blood-alcohol test conducted hours after her arrest. But the State refused to bring to the stand the analyst who performed the test. Instead, the State called a different analyst. Using the results of the test after her arrest and the rate at which alcohol is metabolized, this analyst sought to estimate for the jury Ms. Stuart's blood-alcohol level hours earlier when she was driving. Through these steps, the State effectively denied Ms. Stuart the chance to confront the witness who supplied a foundational piece of evidence in her conviction. The engine of cross-examination was left unengaged, and the Sixth Amendment was violated.\nTo be fair, the problem appears to be largely of our creation. This Court's most recent foray in this field, Williams v. Illinois, 567 U.S. 50, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012), yielded no majority and its various opinions have sown confusion in courts across the country. See, e.g., State v. Dotson, 450 S.W.3d 1, 68 (Tenn.2014) (\"The Supreme Court's fractured decision in Williams provides little guidance and is of uncertain precedential value\"); State v. Michaels, 219 N.J. 1, 31, 95 A.3d 648, 666 (N.J.2014) ( \"We find Williams 's force, as precedent, at best unclear\"); United States v. Turner, 709 F.3d 1187, 1189 (C.A.7 2013) ; United States v. James, 712 F.3d 79, 95 (C.A.2 2013).\nThis case supplies another example of that confusion. Though the opinion of the Alabama court is terse, the State defends it by arguing that, \"[u]nder the rule of the Williams plurality,\" the prosecution was free to introduce the forensic report in this case without calling the analyst who prepared it. Brief in Opposition 6. This is so, the State says, because it didn't offer the report for the truth of what it said about Ms. Stuart's blood-alcohol level at the time of the test, only to provide the State's testifying expert a basis for estimating Ms. Stuart's blood-alcohol level when she was driving.\nBut while Williams yielded no majority opinion, at least five Justices rejected this logic-and for good reason.

For even under the plurality's more demanding test, there's no question that Ms. Stuart was in custody when the government conducted its forensic test or that the report was prepared for the primary purpose of securing her conviction.\nRespectfully, I believe we owe lower courts struggling to abide our holdings more clarity than we have afforded them in this area. Williams imposes on courts with crowded dockets the job of trying to distill holdings on two separate and important issues from four competing opinions. The errors here may be manifest, but they are understandable and they affect courts across the country in cases that regularly recur. I would grant review."
