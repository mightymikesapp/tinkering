      "The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.",
      "Today this Court denies petitioners, and perhaps more than 1,000 like them, a chance to challenge the constitutionality of their sentences. They were sentenced under a then-mandatory provision of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, the exact language of which we have recently identified as unconstitutionally vague in another legally binding provision. These petitioners argue that their sentences, too, are unconstitutional. This important question, which has generated divergence among the lower courts, calls out for an answer. Because this Court's decision to deny certiorari precludes petitioners from obtaining such an answer, I respectfully dissent.",
      "The Guidelines directed enhanced punishment for \"career offender[s].\" See USSG \u00a7 4B1.1(a). Defendants qualified as \"career offender [s]\" if they had \"at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" Ibid. There were different ways that a past conviction could count as \"a crime of violence,\" but only one is at issue here: A conviction counted as \"a crime of violence\" if it \"involve[d] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2002). Because it supplied an amorphous catchall at the end of a more definite list, that phrase has been known as the \"residual clause.\" If the phrase sounds familiar, it may be because in Johnson v. United States , 576 U.S. ----, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), this Court considered the exact same language in another provision where it was binding on judges and had the force and effect of law: a statute called the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Like the Guidelines, the ACCA also required enhanced punishments for career offenders. And, like the Guidelines, the ACCA included its own residual clause. In fact, the ACCA's residual clause was identical to the Guidelines' residual clause. See \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) ( \"... involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\").",
      "Johnson struck down the ACCA's residual clause as unconstitutionally vague. 576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2556. You might think that if a sequence of words that increases a person's time in prison is unconstitutionally vague in one legally binding provision, that same sequence is unconstitutionally vague if it serves the same purpose in another legally binding provision. Indeed, after Johnson , the Sentencing Commission deleted the residual clause from the Guidelines. See USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2016). But for petitioners like Brown, who were sentenced long before Johnson , this Court has thus far left the validity of their sentences an open question. See Beckles v. United States , 580 U.S. ----, ----, ---- - ----, 137 S.Ct. 886, 900-901, 901-903, 197 L.Ed.2d 145 (2017) ; id., at ----, n. 4, 137 S.Ct., at 903, n. 4 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring). The Court's decision today all but ensures that the question will never be answered.",
      "The question for a petitioner like Brown, then, is whether he may rely on the right recognized in Johnson to challenge identical language in the mandatory Guidelines. Three Courts of Appeals have said no. See 868 F.3d 297 (C.A.4 2017) (case below);",
      "Raybon v. United States , 867 F.3d 625 (C.A.6 2017) ; United States v. Greer , 881 F.3d 1241 (C.A.10 2018). One Court of Appeals has said yes. See Cross v. United States , 892 F.3d 288 (C.A.7 2018). Another has strongly hinted yes in a different posture, after which point the Government dismissed at least one appeal that would have allowed the court to answer the question directly. See Moore v. United States , 871 F.3d 72, 80-84 (C.A.1 2017) ; see also United States v. Roy , 282 F.Supp.3d 421 (D.Mass. 2017) ; United States v. Roy , Withdrawal of Appeal in No. 17-2169 (CA1). One other court has concluded that the mandatory Guidelines themselves cannot be challenged for vagueness. See In re Griffin , 823 F.3d 1350, 1354 (C.A.11 2016)."

United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1(a) (Nov. 2004) (USSG). At the time, those Guidelines were mandatory. They were \"binding on judges\" and carried \"the force and effect of laws.\" United States v. Booker , 543 U.S. 220, 234, 125 S.Ct. 738, 750, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).\nThe Guidelines directed enhanced punishment for \"career offender[s].\" See USSG \u00a7 4B1.1(a). Defendants qualified as \"career offender [s]\" if they had \"at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" Ibid. There were different ways that a past conviction could count as \"a crime of violence,\" but only one is at issue here: A conviction counted as \"a crime of violence\" if it \"involve[d] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2002). Because it supplied an amorphous catchall at the end of a more definite list, that phrase has been known as the \"residual clause.\" If the phrase sounds familiar, it may be because in Johnson v. United States , 576 U.S. ----, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), this Court considered the exact same language in another provision where it was binding on judges and had the force and effect of law: a statute called the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Like the Guidelines, the ACCA also required enhanced punishments for career offenders. And, like the Guidelines, the ACCA included its own residual clause. In fact, the ACCA's residual clause was identical to the Guidelines' residual clause. See \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) ( \"... involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\").\nJohnson struck down the ACCA's residual clause as unconstitutionally vague. 576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2556. You might think that if a sequence of words that increases a person's time in prison is unconstitutionally vague in one legally binding provision, that same sequence is unconstitutionally vague if it serves the same purpose in another legally binding provision. Indeed, after Johnson , the Sentencing Commission deleted the residual clause from the Guidelines. See USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2016). But for petitioners like Brown, who were sentenced long before Johnson , this Court has thus far left the validity of their sentences an open question. See Beckles v. United States , 580 U.S. ----, ----, ---- - ----, 137 S.Ct. 886, 900-901, 901-903, 197 L.Ed.2d 145 (2017) ; id., at ----, n. 4, 137 S.Ct., at 903, n. 4 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring). The Court's decision today all but ensures that the question will never be answered.\nIn these petitions, that question largely overlaps with a related, timeliness question: whether Brown and his fellow petitioners may rely on the right announced in Johnson , in the ACCA context, to attack collaterally their mandatory-Guidelines sentences. Federal law imposes on prisoners seeking to mount collateral attacks on final sentences \"[a] 1-year period of limitation ... from the latest of\" several events. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). One event that can reopen this window is this Court \"newly recogniz[ing]\" a right and making that right \"retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\" \u00a7 2255(f)(3). The right recognized in the ACCA context in Johnson , we have held, is retroactive on collateral review. Welch v. United States , 578 U.S. ----, ----, 136 S.Ct. 1257, 1265, 194 L.Ed.2d 387 (2016).\nThe question for a petitioner like Brown, then, is whether he may rely on the right recognized in Johnson to challenge identical language in the mandatory Guidelines. Three Courts of Appeals have said no. See 868 F.3d 297 (C.A.4 2017) (case below);\nRaybon v. United States , 867 F.3d 625 (C.A.6 2017) ; United States v. Greer , 881 F.3d 1241 (C.A.10 2018). One Court of Appeals has said yes. See Cross v. United States , 892 F.3d 288 (C.A.7 2018). Another has strongly hinted yes in a different posture, after which point the Government dismissed at least one appeal that would have allowed the court to answer the question directly. See Moore v. United States , 871 F.3d 72, 80-84 (C.A.1 2017) ; see also United States v. Roy , 282 F.Supp.3d 421 (D.Mass. 2017) ; United States v. Roy , Withdrawal of Appeal in No. 17-2169 (CA1). One other court has concluded that the mandatory Guidelines themselves cannot be challenged for vagueness. See In re Griffin , 823 F.3d 1350, 1354 (C.A.11 2016).\nIn addition to Thilo Brown's petition, this Court denies the petitions of Gregory Molette, No. 17-8368; Bobby Jo Gipson and Keith Walker, No. 17-8637; Carlos Wilson, No. 17-8746; Jason Greer, No. 17-8775; Robert Homrich, No. 17-9045; Charles Chubb, No. 17-9379; Terrance Smith, No. 17-9400; John Elwood Buckner, No. 17-9411; and Paul Lewis, No. 17-9490. For the reasons expressed herein, I respectfully dissent from denial of certiorari in their cases as well.\nThis Court accordingly ruled that the mandatory Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment. See United States v. Booker , 543 U.S. 220, 226-227, 125 S.Ct. 738, 745, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Court then rendered the Guidelines advisory by striking down the provisions that had made them mandatory. See id., at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738.\nIndeed, before Booker , this Court consistently held that the Sentencing Guidelines \"b[ound] judges and courts in their uncontested responsibility to pass sentence in criminal cases.\" Mistretta v. United States , 488 U.S. 361, 391, 109 S.Ct. 647, 665, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989) ; see also Stinson v. United States , 508 U.S. 36, 42, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1917, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (\"The principle that the Guidelines Manual is binding on federal courts applies as well to policy statements\"). The lower courts heeded that instruction. See United States v. Hendricks , 171 F.3d 1184, 1186 (C.A.8 1999) (\"The sentencing guidelines are, of course, binding on federal district courts\"); accord, United States v. Lafayette , 337 F.3d 1043, 1051-1052 (C.A.D.C.2003) ; United States v. Stephens , 347 F.3d 427, 430 (C.A.2 2003) ; United States v. Barbosa , 271 F.3d 438, 465 (C.A.3 2001) ; United States v. Bahe , 201 F.3d 1124, 1129, n. 5 (C.A.9 2000) ; United States v. Harriott , 976 F.2d 198, 202-203 (C.A.4 1992) ; United States v. Lee , 957 F.2d 770, 772 (C.A.10 1992)."
