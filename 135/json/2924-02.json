The application as presented is denied. The Court furthermore orders: If the applicants ensure that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is in possession of all information necessary to verify applicants' eligibility under 26 CFR \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(a)or 29 CFR \u00a7 2590.715-2713A(a)or 45 CFR \u00a7 147.131(b)(as applicable), respondents are enjoined from enforcing against the applicants challenged provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related regulations pending final disposition of their petition for writ of certiorari. Nothing in this interim order affects the ability of applicants' or their organizations' employees to obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives. Nor does this order preclude the Government from relying on information provided by applicants, to the extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage under the Act. See Wheaton College v. Burwell,573 U.S. ----, 134 S.Ct. 2806, 189 L.Ed.2d 856 (2014). This order should not be construed as an expression of the Court's views on the merits.
