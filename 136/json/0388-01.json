    "head_matter": "Lloyd RAPELJE, Warden\nv.\nJunior Fred BLACKSTON.\nNo. 15-161.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nNov. 30, 2015.\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\nJustice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS and Justice ALITO join, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\nA criminal defendant \"shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 6. We have held that this right entitles the accused to cross-examine witnesses who testify at trial, and to exclude certain out-of-court statements that the defendant did not have a prior opportunity to cross-examine. Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 50-51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) ; Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 315-317, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974). We have never held-nor would the verb \"to confront\" support the holding-that confrontation includes the right to admit out-of-court statements into evidence. Nevertheless, the Sixth Circuit held not only that the Confrontation Clause guarantees the right to admit such evidence but that our cases have \"clearly established\" as much. We should grant certiorari and summarily reverse.\nRespondent Junior Fred Blackston was convicted in Michigan state court of first-degree murder on the strength of the testimony of five people, some of whom participated in the crime. For reasons not relevant here, the court ordered a new trial. Before Blackston's retrial, however, two of the five witnesses signed written statements recanting their trial testimony. The prosecution called them at the second trial, but they refused to answer any questions. The trial court therefore pronounced them \"unavailable\" and, pursuant to a venerable hearsay exception, see Mich. Rule Evid. 804(b)(1) (2012); cf. 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1370, p. 55 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1974), allowed their earlier testimony to be read to the jury. But the court refused to admit into evidence their written recantations.\nBlackston was once again convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Affirming the conviction, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the trial court's exclusion of the recantations was not error and, even if it was, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 481 Mich. 451, 751 N.W.2d 408 (2008).\nThis petition for federal habeas relief followed. The District Court conditionally granted the writ, finding that the exclusion of the recantations violated Blackston's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. 907 F.Supp.2d 878 (E.D.Mich.2012). A divided Sixth Circuit panel affirmed. 780 F.3d 340 (2015). In the Court of Appeals' view, \"[t]here is a clearly established right to impeach the credibility of an adverse witness using the witness's own inconsistent statements.\" Id., at 348. The recantations, reasoned the court, were inconsistent statements that had obvious impeachment value.\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) prohibits federal courts from granting habeas relief unless the state court's decision \"involved an unreasonable application of ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added).
